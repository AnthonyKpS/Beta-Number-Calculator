# Beta Number Calculator
The Beta Number Calculator is a simple app written in python that calculates the so called Beta Number in [finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_(finance)).


# Why I made this?
This simple program is an assignment sidetask of the Corporate Finance class of the [Department of Acccounting & Finance of AUEB](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/el/loxri).


## How to use it?
The program takes as input a .csv file which should include the 2 columns of numbers on which the calculations will take place. The file should be located inside the directory the program is running in. Extensive input checking was not my priority so be careful ðŸ˜‚
